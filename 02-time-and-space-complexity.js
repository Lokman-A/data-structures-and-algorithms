// In computer science, the time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm.

// The space complexity of an algorithm or a computer program is the amount of memory space required to solve an instance of the computational problem as a function of characteristics of the input. It is the memory required by an algorithm until it executes completely.
