// In computer science, the time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm.

// The space complexity of an algorithm or a computer program is the amount of memory space required to solve an instance of the computational problem as a function of characteristics of the input. It is the memory required by an algorithm until it executes completely.

// Asymptotic notations are the mathematical notations used to describe the running time of an algorithm when the input tends towards a particular value or a limiting value.

// Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.

// Omega notation represents the lower bound of the running time of an algorithm.

// Theta notation encloses the function from above and below. Since it represents the upper and the lower bound of the running time of an algorithm, it is used for analyzing the average-case complexity of an algorithm. Theta bounds the function within constants factors
